# Wolfram Language

Wolfram Language (nee _Mathematica_) support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

> It is in its early development stages, so not quite ready to add to the Extensions Marketplace yet. Lots of boilerplate from `yo code` still in here, &c. I've put it up in this state in case someone is interested in using it as-is, or perhaps in helping out.

It is based, in part, on the syntax and snippet files from the [Mathematica TextMate Bundle](https://github.com/dehowell/mathematica-tmbundle) by David Howell, Shad Sharma, Eric Wort, and Stephan (stschiff), transliterated using the [`yo code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode) extension generation framework.

It has been updated to include symbol definitions from version 11.1 of _Mathematica_ as well as other interesting syntactic support.
