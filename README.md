# Wolfram Language

![logo](images/logo.png)

Wolfram Language (nee _Mathematica_) support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

> It is in its early development stages, so not quite ready to relase a 1.0 to the Extensions Marketplace yet. Lots of boilerplate from `yo code` still in here, &c. I've put it up in this state in case someone is interested in using it as-is, or perhaps in helping out.

It presently includes symbol definitions from version 11.2 of _Mathematica_ as well as other simple syntactic support.
